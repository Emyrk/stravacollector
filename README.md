# Tour Das Hugel

Hello and welcome to my scrapped together Tour Das Hugel results tracker. This code is _mostly_ organized, and is _mostly_ stable. If you find any bugs or issues, please leave [make an issue](https://github.com/Emyrk/stravacollector/issues) to help me out.

# Not an Austin Cyclist? What the heck is this?

Tour das Hugel is an annual cycling event in Austin. It is not an official event, yet hundreds of cyclists gather for it. Of the hundreds, a smaller fraction will complete the course in it's entirety.

The course is designed to hit as many of the toughest climbs in Austin in a singular ride. Making this ride very challenging, not only by it's raw metrics alone, 112mi with ~12k ft, but with the constant steep ramps to endure.

For this reason, many participants will partake in a portion of the route.


## Ok, so what is this website?

Since this is not an official event, there is no timings. No results page. No medals, no ribbons, no trophies, not even a gathering at the "finish". 

This websites serves as a ribbon to finishers. A medal to the competitive. And a results list for the spectator.

The website polls Strava user's cycling activities, and uses Strava's segments feature to determine if any given activity classifies as a Hugel. If it does, only the climbs are included in the finisher's result time. This ignores things like waiting at stop lights, bombing descents, or other activities that would encourage unsafe riding practices.
